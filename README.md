# CBTCIP Internship Projects

During my internship, I developed two projects:

1. [Guess the Number](#guess-the-number)
2. [Online Examination System](#online-examination-system)

Each project has its own folder with detailed information on how to run them.

## Guess the Number

A Java-based "Guess the Number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game includes features such as:
- Limiting the number of attempts
- Multiple rounds
- Displaying the score
- Giving points based on the number of attempts

### How to Run

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Run GuessTheNumber.java to start the application.

For more details, see the Guess the Number README.

## Online Examination System
A Java-based online examination system with the following functionalities:

Login
Update profile and password

Timer and auto submit
Close session and logout

## How to Run
